# Exercise 7: Factorial of a Number
# 1.Create a function named factorial that takes a positive integer as a parameter and
# returns its factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is
#  the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
# # 2.Demonstrate the usage of this function by calculating the factorial of 5.


def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
   return n
  elif n < 1:
   return ("false")
  else:
   return n * factorial(n-1)
print (factorial(int(5)))
factorial(5)
